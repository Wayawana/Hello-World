# Hello-World
I am a novice looking for help
I am a student studying physics in electronics and computer sciences and I have learned a few languages especially C++, C# and a little about java. I am very interested in coding and hope to learn more here. I am also interested in NetDuino and Arduino programming. I wish to learn as many languages as I can. Thank you.
